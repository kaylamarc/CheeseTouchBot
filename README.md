# CheeseTouchBot
Discord bot written in C# that assigns a member the CheeseTouch Role when the member says the secret codeword. This member then sets a new key word in a private chat with the CheeseTouch Bot. Codewords cannot be reused and a blacklist of non-usable words is provided. This blacklist initially contains the top 100 most used words.
